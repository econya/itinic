## IT in Intentional Communities

Living in the ecovillage Sieben Linden in north of Germany, I struggle with my
tasks as software developer and systems administrator.

Being the only person with a severe IT background I realized that what I lack
is a network of like-minded people that are open for collaboration and
knowledge transfer/exchange.

itinic is an attempt to build a platform where like-minded people can register
and network to make our world a better place (in the long run) or show
that they are open and can be connected to, to make IT staff business of
Intentional Communities easier (in the short run).

Note that I am freakily busy and itinic is really just a hack.
It was created in my 'free' time (dont tell my wife or my friends) and I cannot
guarantee any maintenance effort.
